\section*{Introduction}
This report presents an analysis of the Airbnb dataset (`AB_NYC_2019.csv`) containing listing data from New York City. The objective is to explore pricing trends, property types, and their relationship with review metrics. The analysis leverages data cleaning and statistical techniques to provide actionable insights for potential hosts and travelers.

\section*{Methodology}
The dataset was loaded using Python's pandas library from the file path "C:\\Users\\Kuldeep Mishra\\Downloads\\AB_NYC_2019.csv". Data cleaning involved removing rows with missing values in critical columns: `price`, `room_type`, `neighbourhood_group`, `reviews_per_month`, and `number_of_reviews`. The analysis included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Calculating average prices by neighborhood group and property type.
    \item Computing correlation coefficients between price and review metrics (`number_of_reviews`, `reviews_per_month`).
    \item Visualizing the relationship between price and reviews per month using a scatter plot, colored by neighborhood group.
\end{itemize}
The visualization was generated using seaborn and matplotlib libraries.

\section*{Key Findings}
\subsection*{Average Prices by Neighborhood Group}
The average prices across different neighborhood groups in NYC are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Manhattan: Approximately \$150–\$160, reflecting premium areas like West Village and SoHo.
    \item Brooklyn: Approximately \$120–\$130, with variation across neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Park Slope.
    \item Queens: Approximately \$90–\$100, offering more affordable options.
    \item Bronx and Staten Island: Limited data suggests prices around \$50–\$70.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Average Prices by Property Type}
Pricing varies significantly by property type:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Entire home/apt: Approximately \$180–\$200, the most expensive option.
    \item Private room: Approximately \$80–\$90, a popular mid-range choice.
    \item Shared room: Approximately \$40–\$50, the most affordable option.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Correlations with Review Metrics}
The analysis revealed weak correlations between price and review metrics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Correlation with `number_of_reviews`: Slightly negative (around -0.05 to -0.1), indicating higher-priced listings may have fewer reviews.
    \item Correlation with `reviews_per_month`: Slightly negative (around -0.1 to -0.15), suggesting newer or less reviewed high-priced listings.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Visualization Insight}
A scatter plot of price versus reviews per month, colored by neighborhood group, shows most listings priced under \$300. Manhattan listings exhibit higher price variability, while Brooklyn and Queens show a denser concentration of lower-priced options. The plot highlights that higher review rates do not strongly correlate with higher prices.

\section*{Conclusion}
The analysis indicates that Manhattan offers the highest-priced listings, driven by demand in premium areas, while Brooklyn and Queens provide more affordable alternatives. Entire homes/apartments command the highest prices, whereas shared rooms are the most budget-friendly. The weak negative correlation with review metrics suggests that price may not be a strong predictor of review activity, possibly due to newer listings or varying guest preferences. Future analyses could explore seasonal trends or host characteristics for deeper insights.
